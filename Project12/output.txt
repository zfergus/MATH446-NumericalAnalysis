Model: f(t) = 229.711 + 33.5316 * cos(2*pi*t) + 25.5689* sin(2*pi*t) + -22.1627 * cos(4*pi*t)

This model accurately captures the periodic cycle of energy
usage. The model also represents the decrease in energy usage
during temperate months. Energy usage decreases in spring as
users turn off central heating. Energy usage increases in the
summer as users start to turn on air conditioning. The presented
model captures this trend.
